# Arguments : defined on the command line.
# 1 - run identifier (pid)
# 2 - bundle number (bundle)
# 3 - thread number for this echo file (g)
# 4 - seed value (seed)
# 5 - typing speed in cps (cps)
# 6 - per-transaction think time (think)
# 7 - number of transactions (ntrans)
# 8 - extra argument 1 (server_1; available for application use)
# 9 - extra argument 2 (server_2; available for application use)
#
# This script needs to generate commands for ptydrive.
#
#   -  ptydrive takes its instructions from the input stream with respect
#      to:
#      - Typing rates (the R command)
#      - Sleeps (the W command)
#      - Timestamps (the T command)
#        A Timestamp command  starts a timestamp sequence; the other
#        timestamps are looked for.
#
#        Further timestamps are written when the appropriate events are spotted.
#
#   -  The input definition is terminal independent rather than RDBMS
#      forms specific, and is based on either TERMINFO (standard) or
#      TERMCAP (when terminfo is not supported, ie. old Ultrix)
#
# Whitespace and comments are ignored.
# Command sequences control timestamping, think times etc..
# - S details; declare a timestamp
# - Tlabel; take a timestamp, and label it with the label
# - Wwait time; wait this number of seconds
# - Rtyping rate; keys per second
#
# key sequences are inserted into the pty buffer as individual
# characters if they are delimited by ' or ", and as a single key
# stroke if they are enclosed in `. In the latter case, the \ is an
# escape character, should the ` itself or a \ be in the escape sequence
# Thus we cater for escape sequences that have not been defined with
# terminfo or termcap.
# 
# No single sequence should be more than BUFLEN (4096) characters.
